# CommafeedSync

**CommafeedSync** is a lightweight tool written in Go that syncs a declarative YAML configuration of feed categories and subscriptions into a running [CommaFeed](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed) instance.

This tool is useful for teams and individuals who want to manage CommaFeed categories and feeds using a GitOps-friendly YAML file â€” ideal for automation in CI/CD pipelines or homelabs.
